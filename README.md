# Research on LLM-Based Conversational NPC Systems for Games
[English](README.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md)  
<sub>*This project is a **2025 Capstone Design Project** conducted under the [Hanshin-OSS-Hub](https://github.com/Hanshin-OSS-Hub) GitHub Organization.*</sub>


## Overview
- This project researches and implements an LLM-based conversational NPC system built on **Unity 6**.  
- To address the limitations of traditional scripted NPCs—such as repetitive dialogue and lack of contextual adaptation—we integrate **state management for dialogue context, emotion, relationships, and long-term memory** with **Redis, MongoDB, and Neo4j**, enabling consistent interaction across multiple NPCs.  
- Through a playable demo, we validate **free-form conversation, context-responsive reactions, and persistent memory**, improving upon prior work that struggled with **multi-character interaction, long-term state retention, and context synchronization**.
